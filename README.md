# How do I use it?
Easy.

1. clone to your dev environment
1. navigate inside the folder
1. run `node main.js`
1. pick a number from the array shown on screen
1. type that number
1. press `Enter`

# Why?

Although Binary Search makes sense to me at a concept level. I wanted to experiment and actually implement it into something. It also gave me the chance to freshen up on the Node stdin stream, as well as how to create arrays of x amount of elements that are pseudo random and sorted at the same time.

TL;DR Because I wanted to practice.
